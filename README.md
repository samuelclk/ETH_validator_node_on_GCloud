## Why write another ETH staking guide?

While there are already existing guides out there on how to set up an ETH validator node, I find that they tend to assume some basic level of working technical knowledge.&#x20;

Sometimes seemingly obvious but important steps are skipped which prevents completely non-technical but aspiring node operators to give up.&#x20;

Hence, I put this guide together catering to the laymen. With this, I hope to bring you guys from zero-to-one on your journey as an ETH validator node operator!

**Some key features of this guide:**

1. Highly copy-paste-able shell bash commands + step-by-step instructions for non-command procedures
2. Catered towards using Google Cloud's services for the staking infrastructure / hardware
3. Optimised to slashing and inactivity leaks (instead of cost)
4. Covers the conceptual understanding of how validators work under the hood and how slashing happens
5. How to decide which validator clients to use as a newcomer
6. Nethermind (EL) + Teku (CL) client set

Coming up next, I will also be building more guides covering the following:

1. <mark style="background-color:orange;">different client sets</mark>
2. <mark style="background-color:blue;">cost-efficient home setups</mark>&#x20;
3. <mark style="background-color:green;">enterprise-level setups</mark>&#x20;
4. <mark style="background-color:purple;">specific use cases</mark> - e.g. migrating clients, setting backup nodes, external signer & HSM, MEV Boost, Telegram/Discord monitoring bots
