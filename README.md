While there are already existing guides out there on how to set up an ETH validator node, I found that they tend to assume some level of working technical knowledge.&#x20;

Sometimes seemingly obvious but important steps are skipped which prevents completely non-technical but aspiring node operators to give up.&#x20;

Hence, I put this guide together catering to the laymen. With this, I hope to bring you guys from zero-to-one on your journey as an ETH validator node operator!

**Some key features of this guide:**

1. Catered towards using Google Cloud's services for the staking infrastructure / hardware
2. Optimised to slashing and inactivity leaks (instead of cost)
3. Covers the conceptual understanding of how validators work under the hood and how slashing happens
4. How to decide which validator clients to use as a newcomer
5. Nethermind (EL) + Teku (CL) client set

I will be releasing guides covering <mark style="background-color:orange;">different client sets</mark>, <mark style="background-color:blue;">cost-efficient home setups</mark>, and <mark style="background-color:green;">enterprise-level setups</mark> next. **Drop your email below so you don't miss it!**
