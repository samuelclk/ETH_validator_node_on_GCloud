# Acquiring 32 ETH (or more)

* If you are going from fiat (e.g. USD, SGD, MYR) to crypto, you will need to use an on-ramp platform. It should not matter too much which platform you decide to use as long as they are reputable and regulated (in your own region). This is because you will be transferring your ETH out as soon as you have bought them.

**Some examples below:**

| Platform      | Type                 | Deposit fees                 | Withdrawal fees  | Trading fees            |
| ------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------- |
| Coinhako      | Centralised exchange | Free                         | SGD 2            | 0.6%                    |
| Argent Wallet | Wallet               | at least 1.5% (via Moon Pay) | Onchain gas fees | 0.5% + Onchain gas fees |
| Crypto.com    | Centralised exchange | 0.55% (via Xfers)            | 0.005 ETH        | 0.0750%                 |

After you purchase your ETH, transfer it out into your own self-custodial wallet ASAP.

_Do note that for withdrawals of assets to your self-custodial wallets, you might have to follow additional instructions provided by the respective platforms above to adhere to "travel rules" of your respective jurisdictions._



* If you already have USDC in your wallet, you can connect your wallet to Metamask and use [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) to swap USDC for ETH.
