# Google Uptime Check

## Pre-requisites

You must configure port forwarding to ports 30303 and 9000 of your validator node in order for Google Uptime Check to work.

Refer to the [Preparing your virtual machine](../../hardware-and-software-requirements/preparing-your-vm-validator-node.md) sub-section of this guide to understand how to.

## Setup

Log in to your google cloud console and type _**"monitoring"**_ into the search bar. Then select the _**"Monitoring - Infrastructure and application quality checks"**_ result.&#x20;

You will be prompted to enter the following:

1. Protocol: `TCP`
2. Resource type: `URL`
3. Hostname: `<the external IP address of your beacon node>`
4. Port: `30303`&#x20;

_**\*Port 30303 checks for the uptime of the execution layer client. Repeat this step for Port 9000 as well to check for the uptime of the consensus layer client.**_

Click through the default settings until _**Step 3 - Alert & Notification**_. Then click on the _**"Notification channels"**_ drop down and then _**"MANAGE NOTIFICATION CHANNELS"**_

Set up your favourite notification channels. I like to keep it simple by using email as my alerts channel.&#x20;

Next, key in the name of the alert you created and test the service. If the connection is successful, you will see a "success" message.

Go ahead and click _**"CREATE"**_  to complete the setup.

_**Congrats! You have set up a free alerts tool to check if each of your clients are running. This is useful to identify out-of-memory, database corruption, power/internet, or hardware issues.**_
