# Responsibilities of a node operator

## The responsibility

Running an ETH validator node is a long term commitment. Your staked ETH will not be liquid while it is being staked and there will be lead time on both entering and exiting the validator queue.

Once your validator is activated, you have to be keep it running 24/7 and there will be penalties for inactivity / going offline.

This means that you have to invest in adequate hardware, a suitable space / environment to run your validator node from, and time to monitor / maintain / troubleshoot your node periodically.

You will also need to keep up to date with the latest developments across your execution and consensus client software as well as the overall Ethereum consensus mechanism.&#x20;
